There should be a third option to close the application


Inorder to achieve this we will be using the java concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance 
Setting up Git and GitHub account to store and track your enhancements of the prototype 
We will be planning more than two sprints to complete the application
Documenting the flow of the application and we prepare a flow chart
Documentation also consists of conclusion on enhancing the application and defining the USPs (Unique Selling Points)
